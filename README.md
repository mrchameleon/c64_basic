10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
(type run, press enter)


10 FOR Y = 1 TO 10

You can either retype the line to replace it
change 10 to 100 (enter)

You can also copy and paste lines this way

10 PRINT "HELLO"
move cursor to 10,  replace with 20,   press enter and it will duplicate
there is may be some trickiness doing this with emulator, because it can erase to the right (like insert key function)
